      <h3>Contribution</h3>
      <p>
        A british medical software company were in dire need of a redesign.  The whole system built on Java with jsp templating, it was a little painful.  I managed to add bootstrap and start to make things responsive.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the biggest challenges was to support IE8 as this was used by hospitals that do not update their computers.  This was achieved by using a few different libraries, breakpoints.js, css fillers, old versions of bootstrap, font awesome, modernizr.
